v0.5.0
  date: Oct 20, 2013
  BREAKING CHANGES:
  - graph.addNode() no longer augments old data model with whatever passed
    to method. Instead it stores direct reference to passed node's model
  - node/link objects no longer store layout specific properties. Instead you can
    query all layout properties from layout class itself. This allows the same
    graph to be layed out by two different layout algorithm, without stepping
    on toes of each other
  - node/link objects no longer store ui specific properties. Instead you
    can query them from specific UI provider
